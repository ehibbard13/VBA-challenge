Module 2 Challenge

I used the first row to name my module, then the next row to create a loop
to run through all worksheets. 
The next 13 lines I defined all of the variables that I needed and set some
values.
After that I hard coded in the column/row titles and formatted the titles
to auto fit.
After that I created a for i loop to run the codes needed to calulate the
tickers, yearly change, percent change, and total stock. 
I then formatted the column necessary.
After that I used the perviously calculated values to find the greatest %
increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume and got a bit of help with this code by using github.
